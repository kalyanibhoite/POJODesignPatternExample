# POJO Design Pattern Example
The Transfer Object pattern is used when we want to pass data with multiple attributes in one shot from client to server.

Transfer object is also known as Value Object. Transfer Object is a simple POJO class having getter/setter methods & Constructor.
It must have a public default constructor.It may have the arguments constructor.
All objects must have some public Getters and Setters to access the object values by other Java Programs & It's help to create an object outside the class. 
The getter methods return the values of the respective variables, while the setter methods set new values for the variables.
ToStringMethod help to print the one line description of output. 
Thanks.
